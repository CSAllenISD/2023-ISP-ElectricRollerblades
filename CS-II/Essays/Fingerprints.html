      HTTPS, also known as SSL or TLS, provides privacy and security to the user by encrypting their data as they surf the web. Before HTTPS, there was HTTP which allowed anyone to track and direct the traffic of the internet.

      In recent years, the development of HTTPS Proxy Appliances have disrupted the reason HTTPS was created. Frequently  used by schools, companies, and other private organizations, these Proxy Appliances allow the institution to control where the users go and how they interact with the internet.

      Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) certificates use hashes to protect the privacy and security of a website and the user. Hashes use algorithms to encode each fingerprint’s bit to design a specific key. There are multiple hashes in existence, such as the MD5, but a more secure algorithm is found in the SHA1 which uses hexadecimal formatting and lets it so that the fingerprint’s case and use of colons do not matter. This makes it hard for SSL proxies to copy/alter the fingerprint to intercept the website.
