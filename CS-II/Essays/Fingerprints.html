      HTTPS, also known as SSL or TLS, provides privacy and security to the user by encrypting their data as they surf the web. Before HTTPS, there was HTTP which allowed anyone to track and direct the traffic of the internet.
    </p>    
    <p class="paragraph">
      In recent years, the development of HTTPS Proxy Appliances have disrupted the reason HTTPS was created. Frequently  used by schools, companies, and other private organizations, these Proxy Appliances allow the institution to control where the users go and how they interact with the internet.

      Another way a website can be hacked is through a Man in the Middle (MITM) attack. In this situation, the man in the middle is a person who puts themself between a user and the application they are trying to access. From the user’s point of view, it seems as though the connection is perfect and as if there is no MITM, when in reality the MITM is able to eavesdrop and act as the application and/or user. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) certificates use hashes to protect the privacy and security of a website and the user. Hashes use algorithms to encode each fingerprint’s bit to design a specific key. There are multiple hashes in existence, such as the MD5, but a more secure algorithm is found in the SHA1 which uses hexadecimal formatting and lets it so that the fingerprint’s case and use of colons do not matter. This makes it hard for SSL proxies to copy/alter the fingerprint to intercept the website.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Certificate Authorities(CA) are entities that websites present their identities to in the real world. These certificate authorities are used to verify if the website is secured and trusted which allows the web browser to authenticate websites. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      When an SSL certificate has been intercepted, the site’s fingerprint will be entirely different from the original fingerprint. This can be checked by accessing the certificate’s fingerprint through a browser’s properties. SSL interception can be prevented by using a browser, such as Firefox and Chrome, that uses Extended Validation (VA) to make sure the website is not being intercepted. EV’s are essentially a second certificate used to verify the site’s fingerprint. If an EV authenticates a site, then it is 100% protected because browsers, other than Internet Explorer, only display 100% Extended Validation certificates.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      False-positives happen when large sites, like Amazon, utilize multiple security certificates which means people may get different certificates. This gives off the impression that the site has been compromised and is therefore unsafe when in reality the site is secure. On the other hand, false-negatives can occur when the site is excluded from SSL-interception and appears safe when in reality it is not.
