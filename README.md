# 2023-ISP-ElectricRollerblades

This is the branch for our cad stress analysis, where we are able to analyze our models and designs before production in terms of stability and sturdiness to save on cost of producting more versions than needed. 
<br>
## Constraints of Analysis: 
<br>
the design has to support weight up to 100 lbs per side downwardly. 
<br>
the design has to support weight up to 50 lbs per side when side loaded at wheel mount.
<br>
the design has to support weight up to 50 lbs per side when side loaded at suspensioning system.

### MVP Update
<br>
the current minimal deisng for the product have undergo all analysis for stress testing and have shown decent stability, we are okay to proceed from this design and begin production. 
<br>
We had to redesign the back support bracket of the roller skate, so I redid the stress analysis of both downwards stress and sideloading in the bridge. The design did not pass the downwards stress test the first time due to one of the bracket was too thin at certain parts, but after redesigning the bracket, we were able to proceed through the analysis.
