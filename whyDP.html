    <h1 class="title"><strong>Why is this Digital Portfolio important to me?</strong></h1>
    <p class="paragraph">This digital portfolio allows me to show off my creativity and skill in coding to future employers, fellow CS students, and others in general. This is a place where I am able to put any important information and updates over the years. As I continue to work on this portfolio, I hope to show my growth in dedication and skill in programming.</p>
