      My group created a website(NEXT) dedicated to a Nail Bar & Spa where customers can learn about our nail specialists through social media links, our products, and where they are able to book appointments.

    <h2 class="title">Motivation:</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Instead of creating a simple game, we first wanted to create a website where we could display original pieces of art. When that didn't work, we decided on creating a website for our made-up company, NEXT, that was able to function similarily to other companies selling products.

    <h2 class="title">Conclusions:</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      It was hard to balance the work between our group since we were all somewhat new to coding a website using multiple languages at once. Time managements was definitely the hardest aspect since we were all battling with finals. Our original idea of creating a website to exhibit art pieces didn't work out because we had trouble uploading pictures and linking them into the code. In the end, it all worked out when we decided to try another concept of displaying art through nail art and creating a sort of shopping website.
