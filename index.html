	Hello! My name is Danelle Corbita. I am currently a senior at Allen High School and in my second year of Computer Science. Other than being a student, I also participate in extracurricular clubs at Allen High, such as Eagle Robotics. Through the school's robotics team, I was able to develop my skills as a programmer by learning how to use Java to help code and wire our robots. I am currently the president of Eaglets, a club founded by Eagle Robotics, that reaches out to young, elementary school kids aged 9-12 and works with them to teach programming through arduino on our own self-designed kits.
