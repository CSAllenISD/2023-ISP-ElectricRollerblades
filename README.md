This is the branch for our cad stress analysis, where we are able to analyze our models and designs before production in terms of stability and sturdiness to save on cost of producting more versions than needed.

the current minimal deisng for the product have undergo all analysis for stress testing and have shown decent stability, we are okay to proceed from this design and begin production.
